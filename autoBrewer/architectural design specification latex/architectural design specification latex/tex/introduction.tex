The DOOM hopper will provide any home or commercial brewing system with some automated boil management. The goal is to read a recipe and according to the recipe it will add and remove hops. The recipe will be documented in a '*.bs' file, and this system will have 4 layers: brain, interface, motor control and miscellaneous system. The brain will serve as a central hub for the entire system. The motor control will handle the physical aspects like transporting the hops to the kettle through a pully system and motors. The interface acts as a menu for the user so they can select the appropriate recipe and pulleys for their brew. Miscellaneous system is components that require no input or output but required for the structural integrity of the system.

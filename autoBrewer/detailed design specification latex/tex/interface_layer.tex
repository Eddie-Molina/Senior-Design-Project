The interface layer will serve as the software structure of the brewing system. It will act similar to a menu for the user to choose their recipe through the webpage and be held on a server, specifically a raspberry pi. The languages being used for the webpage are Python, HTML and CSS mainly but if necessary, Javascript may be used. We will also create an android app that will act as an alternative interface that will be programmed in android studio.

\subsection{Interface Software Dependencies}
The webpage only relies on a couple python libraries and the android app will rely on maybe one library. They both rely on the brain.

\subsection{Android App}
The Android App will communicate with the raspberry pi to provide an interface for the user to utilize the hop machine. An alternative to the webpage.

\subsubsection{Android App Software Dependencies}
The app will rely on very few libraries that are provided in android studio.

\subsubsection{Android App Programming Languages}
The app is being programmed in Android Studio so essentially java with some app libraries.

\subsubsection{Android App Data Structures}
Only one data structure which is the recipe class that will hold the recipes.

\subsection{Webpage}
It will act as the same thing as the android app and more of the main structure.

\subsubsection{Webpage Software Dependencies}
The webpage is using some scripting languages and a couple of python libraries.

\subsubsection{Webpage Programming Languages}
The webpage is going to be done in HTML, CSS and Python.

\subsubsection{Webpage Data Structures}
Only one data structure which is the recipe class that will hold the recipes.

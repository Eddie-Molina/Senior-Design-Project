The product our team is designing is an automated brewing system. The mission of this project will be to allow users to brew beer at the push of a button with minimal
supervision of the brewing process. The system will include: a heating devcie that is programmed to be on at certain time intervals, solenoid valves that will allow cooling
water to pass through a heat exchanger, dumping mechanisms to drop special grains and hops into a stainless steel kettle, and a 6 gallon fermenter.

\subsection{Features \& Functions}
The product will be a brewing system that will be automated as much as possible. Limiting factors will be our budget and the teams experience with automated systems.


\subsection{External Inputs \& Outputs}
The Automated Brewing System will have an external heating device with timing capabilities in order to heat liquids at 
certain timing intervals. Another external device will be attatched for dumping specialty grains and hops into the heated liquid, which will
then be boiled for a period of time by the programmed heating device. Also to be included in the system will be a programmable solenoid valve which will
allow cooling water to pass through a heat exchanger to cool the wort.

\subsection{Product Interfaces}
Attached to the brewing system will be an interactive GUI display which will allow the user to start and stop the brewing process.

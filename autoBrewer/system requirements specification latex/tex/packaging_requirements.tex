%Include a header paragraph here. Packaging requirements are those requirements that identify how the delivered product will be packaged for delivery to the end-user; or how it will "look" when finished and delivered. For example, you might specify that the software required for operation will be pre-loaded on the hard drive, delivered on CD/DVD, or available via download. Software might be customer installable, or not, etc. Hardware components could be all in a single package, provided as a "bag of parts" to be assembled/installed by the user, painted a certain color, logos affixed, etc. Care should be taken not to duplicate requirements found in other sections of this document.


Software will be preloaded onto the device and ready to use. Hardware will have some assembly required and no more tha five seperate parts. It will have a large logo affixed to the pot, but for the most part will be undecorated and unpainted to avoid posible poisoning issues.

Our biggest goal is to keep the budget under \$800, but could possibly be exceeded if needed.

\subsection{Preliminary Budget}
We are to put a \$500 budget on hardware materials and \$300 on any other necessities.

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
Funds will be received from UTA with the \$800 they give us, as well as any other donations.
